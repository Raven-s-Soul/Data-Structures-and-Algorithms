# Problems Complexity
> [!NOTE]
> ## Every problem can have a lower or higher bound.
>>     The core is that a problem can be Theta n
>>     Becouse there is a solution that works on Theta n
>>     But every other Solution/Algorithm that is slower still is a solution
> If a solution is faster then a lowebound means:
> - 1 The soulution you found has some kind of errors
> - 2 You have just found a new lowerbound
>
> ## How to define a lowerbound? `Spoiler is kinda hard`
> - Mostly is already asked in the problem
>>     The sum of all numebers till N
>>     Has to be at least Omega N
> *Remember the difference beetween problems that use confronts and the ones who doesn't*
> ### There are NP-Complet problems that can't be solved in polinomial time.
>
> ### Decisional tree `(search for comparison)`
> Is a tree where every internal node is a confronts and leaves are the output. `The lenght of a tree is Log(n)`
>
> For this reason a sorting by comparison is at least $`n*\log(n)`$.
>

> [!TIP]
> When we write log(n) we ignore the base of the log since may be use tree not binary but tertiary or more.
